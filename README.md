# World_Weather_Analysis


# Overview
Using API data gathered from world weather, I created a simple vacation plan using the weather data available at four sites. Over the course of this module, I grew comfortable with using API calls, and learned how to parse through large JSON files. 

# Process
* First, I got data from world weather using an API call. 
* After Parsing through that data by setting the criteria I wanted 
** This data was temperature (selected 60-80 degrees), hotel lodging, and within a congruous landmass.
** Using Jupyter Notebooks, all results that did not have lodging data was removed, as well as any location lacking country data.
* I then planned a route that took me through these four sites. This was a roadtrip from the coastal regions outside of Chiba, to the Southern most Tip of Kyushuu. 

# Results
I have planned a fun roadtrip through Japan I could take after everything opens back up. One day...
